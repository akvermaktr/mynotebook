    SysV init vs systemdedit
    Kibana is not started automatically after installation. How to start and stop Kibana depends on whether your system uses SysV init or systemd (used by newer distributions). You can tell which is being used by running this command:

    systemctl restart kibana.service
    log path 
    /var/log/kibana/kibana.log

  
3) install log stastack 

install Kibana
