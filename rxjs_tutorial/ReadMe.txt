User Interface
Libraries to help you build rich client applications

Every month, Netflix members around the world discover and watch more than ten billion hours of movies and shows on their TV, mobile and desktop devices. Using modern UI technologies like Node.js, React and RxJS, our engineers build rich client applications that run across thousands of devices. We strive to create cinematic, immersive experiences that delight our members, exhibit exceptional performance and work flawlessly. We're continuously improving the product through data-driven A/B testing that enables us to experiment with novel concepts and understand the value of every feature we ship.

We created Falcor for efficient data fetching. We help maintain Restify to enable us to scale Node.js applications with full observability. We're helping to build the next version of RxJS to improve its performance and debuggability.
