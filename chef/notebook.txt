 ===============
 A Chef resource describes one part of the system, such as a file or a package. A Chef recipe is a file that groups related resources, such as everything needed to configure a web server, database server, or a load balancer.
 
  * Message of the Day (MOTD) file 
  file '/tmp/motd' do
    content 'hello chef'        #Add content to new tmp file. /tmp/motd
    action :delete              #Delete File 
  end
  
Resources have actions
    example ( action :delete              #Delete File) 
Recipes organize resources

Configure a package and service
===============================
Like files, packages and services are also types of resources. Chef applies resources in the order you specify.
exmple : install httpd service 
package 'httpd' # 
        #We don't need to specify an action because :install is the default  
$ sudo chef-client --local-mode webserver.rb
