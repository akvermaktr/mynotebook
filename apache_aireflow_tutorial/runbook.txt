or example, we need to send an email if a worker finds today’s prices of apple in supermarket A is cheaper than that in supermarket B, and the worker needs to wait until all crawlers finished their processes.
Crawlers [A, B, …, Z] >> Comparison Worker >> Email Alarm
For this, We need Airflow! (Of course, you can run scripts one by one…)


As mentioned in the documentation, you may try Airflow with SQLite as its backend database for experimenting and learning if you don’t want to initiate a real database (mainly MySQL or PostgreSQL). After pip installation success, you can start Airflow (including database, web server and scheduler) simply:
airflow initdb
airflow webserver -p 8080
airflow scheduler
